RELATIONSHIP :

To establish the relationships between the tables and determine the primary key and foreign key relationships, we need to consider the following:

1.Profile Table:

   - Primary Key: Employee ID

2.Attendance Table:

   - Primary Key: (Employee ID, Date)
   - Foreign Key: Employee ID references Profile Table (Employee ID)

3.Payroll Table:

   - Primary Key: (Employee ID, Salary Month)
   - Foreign Key: Employee ID references Profile Table (Employee ID)

4.Leaves Table:

   - Primary Key: (Employee ID, Year)
   - Foreign Key: Employee ID references Profile Table (Employee ID)

Next, let's consider the HRMS module:

1.Profile Entry Screen (Employee Master):

   - Primary Key: Employee ID

2.Attendance Table:

   - Primary Key: (Employee ID, Date)
   - Foreign Key: Employee ID references Profile Entry Screen (Employee ID)

3.Payroll Table:

   - Primary Key: (Employee ID, Salary Month)
   - Foreign Key: Employee ID references Profile Entry Screen (Employee ID)

4.Leave Balances Table:

   - Primary Key: (Employee ID, Year)
   - Foreign Key: Employee ID references Profile Entry Screen (Employee ID)

5.Leave Application Table:

   - Primary Key: (Employee ID, Leave Type, From Date)
   - Foreign Key: Employee ID references Profile Entry Screen (Employee ID)



The primary keys uniquely identify each record within the table, and foreign keys establish the relationships between tables by referring to the primary key of another table.
